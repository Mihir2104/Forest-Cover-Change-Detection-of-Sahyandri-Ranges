# Forest-Cover-Change-Detection-of-Sahyandri-Ranges
The Western Ghats of India being one of the eight most important biodiversity hotspots runs from the western coast of Peninsular India. Through this study we wish to detect change in forest area using Remote sensing technology with the use of satellite images. Satellite images are important for enhancing the analysis of a large area due to their higher spectral resolution. This study aims to detect the forest cover change in the western ghats of India from 2014 to 2022. Sahyadri ranges or western ghats are one of the most green and rich forest mountain ranges in India and therefore even a sensitive change in vegetation can be helpful in decoding as well as forecasting various different geographical changes. We have used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI which is generally used in determining vegetation in a particular patch of land. Classification has been done on the basis of different classes  like low, moderate, high vegetation as well as bare areas and tropical forests. We analyzed values of NDVI of all dataset images of each year from 2014 to 2022 to determine actual change in the forest cover.
